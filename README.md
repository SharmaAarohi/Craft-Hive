# Craft-Hive
CraftHive is an online marketplace that connects handicraft sellers with buyers, enabling seamless transactions and empowering artisans to showcase their unique creations globally. 
Built on the Hive blockchain, CraftHive offers several innovative features:

1. Decentralized Product Listings: Handicraft sellers can create and manage their product listings directly on the Hive blockchain. Each product is associated with a unique identifier stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.

2. Secure Transactions: CraftHive facilitates secure transactions using Hive's fast and fee-less blockchain technology. Smart contracts ensure that funds are held in escrow and released to sellers only upon successful delivery of products, fostering trust between buyers and sellers.

3. Community Governance: CraftHive embraces Hive's decentralized governance model, allowing community members to participate in decision-making processes. Stake-weighted voting via the Decentralized Hive Fund (DHF) enables the community to fund proposals that drive the development of the platform.

4. User-friendly Interface: CraftHive features a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for buyers to discover and purchase handmade products. Sellers can manage their inventory, process orders, and engage with customers seamlessly through the platform.
